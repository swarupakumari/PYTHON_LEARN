# ðŸ”¹ == (Equality Operator)

# Checks values of two objects.

# Returns True if the contents are the same, even if they are different objects in memory.

# Example:

# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [1, 2, 3]

# print(a == b)   # True â†’ because both lists have same contents

# ðŸ”¹ is (Identity Operator)

# Checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory (same reference).

# Returns True only if both variables refer to the exact same object.

# Example:

# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [1, 2, 3]
# c = a

# print(a is b)   # False â†’ different objects in memory
# print(a is c)   # True â†’ both point to the same object
