# ðŸ”¹ Inheritance in Python

# ðŸ‘‰ Definition:
# Inheritance allows a class (child/derived) to acquire properties & methods of another class (parent/base).
# It promotes code reusability.

# ðŸ”¹ Types of Inheritance in Python

# Single Inheritance â†’ One parent, one child.

# Multilevel Inheritance â†’ Child â†’ Grandchild.

# Multiple Inheritance â†’ One child inherits from multiple parents.

# Hierarchical Inheritance â†’ One parent, many children.

# Hybrid Inheritance â†’ Combination of above.

# ðŸ”¹ Example
# Base class
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def show(self):
        print("Name:", self.name)

# Derived class (inherits Person)
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, roll):
        super().__init__(name)   # call parent constructor
        self.roll = roll

    def show(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Roll: {self.roll}")

# Object
s = Student("Swarupa", 101)
s.show()
