# Tuple in Python
# ðŸ”¹ Theory (Easy to Remember)

# A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection in Python.

# Defined using () parentheses (unlike lists that use []).

# Immutable â†’ once created, you cannot change, add, or remove elements.

# Faster than lists (since immutability helps performance).

# Can store heterogeneous data (different types).

# ðŸ”¹ Example
# # Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (10, "Hello", 3.14, True)

print(my_tuple)           # (10, 'Hello', 3.14, True)
print(my_tuple[1])        # Access element â†’ Hello
print(my_tuple[-1])       # Access last element â†’ True

# # Tuple unpacking
# a, b, c, d = my_tuple
# print(a, c)               # 10 3.14

# # Nested tuple
# nested = (1, (2, 3), 4)
# print(nested[1][1])       # 3

# ðŸ”¹ Common Tuple Methods

# (since tuples are immutable, very few methods)

# count() â†’ counts occurrences of a value.

# index() â†’ returns index of first occurrence.

# Example:

# t = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4)
# print(t.count(2))   # 2
# print(t.index(3))   # 3

# ðŸ”¹ Interview Questions

# Q1. Difference between list and tuple in Python?
# ðŸ‘‰ List is mutable ([]), Tuple is immutable (()). Lists are slower, tuples are faster.

# Q2. Why use a tuple if list exists?
# ðŸ‘‰ Tuples are more memory-efficient, faster, and can be used as dictionary keys (since theyâ€™re immutable).

# Q3. Can a tuple contain a list?
# ðŸ‘‰ Yes. But if that list is changed, the tuple still technically remains the same (immutability is only for the tuple structure).

# âœ¨ Quick Trick to Remember:
# ðŸ‘‰ List = Flexible (mutable), Tuple = Fixed (immutable).
